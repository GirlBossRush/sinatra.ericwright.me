    My name is Eric Wright and I make web applications. Check out my #{link_to "portfolio", "/work"} while you're here, I'm always eager to show off my work.

    ### simple and clean
    I like to create minimalist interfaces while retaining powerful usability. I enjoy CSS3 driven design and work toward minimizing unnecessary Javascript.

    ### agile development
    Software engineering is a creative process and requirements evolve with the project. The best way to plan your next step is to move forward and adapt.

    ### I do other stuff too
    I enjoy #{link_to "Hacker News", "http://news.ycombinator.com", :target => :blank} and #{link_to "Reddit","http://reddit.com", :target => :blank}, a little too much. I'm a big fan of Daft Punk, The Avalanches, Coheed and Cambria or anything with a progressive rock feel.
