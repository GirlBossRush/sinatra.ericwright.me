      # I write software
      My name is Eric Wright and I am a web developer.
      I've been working professionally for three years and built a lot of cool stuff,
      all available on #{link_to "Github", "https://github.com/TeffenEllis"}.
      My #{link_to "resume", "/resume"} goes into detail if you're interested.

      ## We're trying to fill a position, have you worked with....
      I like Rails, Backbone.js, and Linux servers.

      Creating software is about engineering, not tools.
      I have a strong understanding of HTML, Javascript, and CSS. I'm also experienced in Heroku and Amazon Cloud deployment.

      #{mail_to "dev@ericwright.me", "Ask me about my floppy disks", subject: "What's up with those floppy disks?"}, if you want to get together and build something.
