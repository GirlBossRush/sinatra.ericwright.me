      # #{header_links "Boardwalk", "http://boardwalk.io"}
      Boardwalk is a personal website framework built to encourage vanity.
      Users can create their own board to fill with blog posts, photos, and other customizable widgets.
      The layout is free form and custom to each user.
      The only limitation is the size of the board.
